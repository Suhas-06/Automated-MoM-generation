Speaker 0: i hope you're able to see misty so this is the tool that we developed and we have also integrated ibm so that the to but for this for distant might be using the discommended professor because it has the highest accesses so so this is what the door looks like in the first place when you line you learn on this project screen and this is a set of products that that favor on already what to create your project what you can do is you can simply go to add project and then basically give any name that you like to okay and that would create a project now when you coincide the project you can add multiple documents that you want to compare right so you can enter either do a dragon drop or just click on upload and then i want to be doing that in this time because it might take a little while to process something look at already processed ten document so these are the two documents that we had of from barclays at the at process and to view these documents what we do is we can go to the view compare history and then we clear continue but which is which will open up a pace that it'll show you the comparison between the two documents now the key idea for this particular beauty was to compare what was promised in the speedy way that it is still a part of the sw so that's why you can see that on the left idea of the isp and on the right we have the s w the document type is listed here and the document name is below it so it's the same on protect now on the extreme idea we'll see basically the announcement in the analysis that we get from a model and this compares both of these documents and then gives us an analysis based on what we have trained for so the first one is pretty obvious that it's it's an hundred and it was matt so we won't look at that it's fine on something that has a little bit of a difference this is exactly same so you can see the confidence but a hundred percent here now if you move further down the sea that this this this has a bit of a difference so if you look on the right time you'll see that it has improved materials selection and product design so it's pretty concerned but if you look on the left side you'll see that there are a certain details that are missing from the right text right like if you can go to a deal see it through consideration for lenses lensivity and ability to be repeated in all of that so when you look at the analysis that has been given by the model you can see that the differences have been clearly outlayed we can see the new disclosure mention several aspects of sustainability that should be considered in the design process such as and and and then it goes on to list the differences now the one unique feature of this is that in addition to the differences it also highlights the disk associated with these disprinters are all the risks associated with missing such important details and the risks have also been being categorizing to several several categories so we have the financial risk we have delivery risk infrastructure is gonna be source risk so this has been this has been really customized for the ps purpose we can have a different kind of risks here and different like we can do different things that this analysis that that is given so because it was that it was a requirement of the psy to highlight the risks is right so that's why we can do this we can certainly entertain other other requests right for this so this is a pretty much other tool box so if you go further down the list you'll see on similar examples of differences yeah so any questions over in the functionality order on how you process document, Start: 0:03, End: 4:04
Speaker 1: is there any pretty use it for the two documents should they be in a simple miller for mad should they be of the same it is there any paid is it, Start: 4:07, End: 4:18
Speaker 0: for, Start: 4:19, End: 4:19
Speaker 1: working so not to help so of what we do is so i'll explain a little bit about the, Start: 4:19, End: 4:25
Speaker 0: processing parts of that that might make it more care so what we do is then we get a particular document we find this particular because he would be hard as we had a clearly outlined section in the document that that we had to look into so of its was the identified based on the text that was there in the in the that in that part of the document so that's how we know that this that this is a technical requirement and this is what will i need to look at so we have a model that that identifies these sections and then exact start part of the document and then send it for the foot for for the processing then then that particular section is for the broken down into sentences which in this case is clearly evident that the we can see the sentences clearly so because this was a small b c to be basically i didn't have you had the smaller documents that were sent to us by the client though that's why it was a little easier but in in cases of larger documents it doesn't matter if one document is docates and another speed if it it is still about the scene so because it is based on identify sick i didn't find sections and then and for the processing and the preprocessing it but for the, Start: 4:25, End: 5:37
Speaker 1: sections you mean understanding the meaning and expecting the concepts out of the documents is it yes so, Start: 5:38, End: 5:47
Speaker 0: generally what happens in the case of a sort of use and i speak that we have different sections for different things so we have a section for let's see technical requirements the other section for obligations so so we have these clear demarcations so it's easier than that in the case of these kind of standard documents but, Start: 5:47, End: 6:08
Speaker 1: given, Start: 6:08, End: 6:09
Speaker 0: like a what kind of document we are dealing with we can obviously customise the process and then make it so that it identifies the correct action based on the language also, Start: 6:10, End: 6:18
Speaker 1: okay so as of no it matches section to section and then within section plays to get that information is it, Start: 6:19, End: 6:25
Speaker 0: yes, Start: 6:25, End: 6:25
Speaker 1: so because it was a very, Start: 6:26, End: 6:27
Speaker 0: particular use case so yeah specific design so that that's why you look at a particular section but that that is also not being done based on language it is not based on where it is in the document, Start: 6:27, End: 6:39
Speaker 1: okay, Start: 6:43, End: 6:43
Speaker 0: complained yeah i right, Start: 6:44, End: 6:47
Speaker 1: and, Start: 6:47, End: 6:47
Speaker 0: then so i like explain a little bit more about the pre processing and then the active processing so then once it is broken down into sentences he basically stored the decent v and these and then he started in that victory we think we are using offer that as a and then once that is done what what is what happens is that we send it to the to the mode that we have running on the item cloud and that basically looks at the looks at the particular sentence and then goes through the group my dv and then finds the nearest match to it and then that's that's how it it is able to identify the defenses and then give us the analysis so for this you're using the lamatote modern which which proved to be quite good in in terms of the responses that we want so we went with that yeah so that's the datasean part of it and that of the action brain of the operation is working, Start: 6:48, End: 7:49
Speaker 1: okay, Start: 7:53, End: 7:53
Speaker 0: yeah so, Start: 7:54, End: 7:57
Speaker 1: in the regarding that was there which we, Start: 7:58, End: 8:03
Speaker 0: had, Start: 8:03, End: 8:03
Speaker 1: seen to shared my god was one more screen where all the concepts fair listed which were derived from the spd okay i think that would be the, Start: 8:03, End: 8:16
Speaker 0: rfp i think you would have gone through the one i can show you that is i have that i think that i know it's getting referring to it, Start: 8:16, End: 8:29
Speaker 1: this particular solution is actually, Start: 8:33, End: 8:35
Speaker 0: platform agnostic so it this one is deployed on europe the one that i'm sure casing right now but we have a similar one working on ipm cloud is like the exact same thing working when i've been traveling so i think this is the one that he might have shown you and uh is this the screen that you refund to this is an if document that has been processed and we have, Start: 8:36, End: 9:05
Speaker 1: similar but it is not the same but i see yeah this is probably it with so these are the sections which are already mentioned in the document or it, Start: 9:06, End: 9:16
Speaker 0: right right so this this somebody that you see this is a generated by the model and when you do when you click on this he directed to the part there it is present in the document so there this is expected from so you have defined in our database which feeds exactly to look into and these feelings have eats gone through a set of different problems and then being analyzed by by data centers to arrive at a particular configuration that that works best for the these particular fees regardless of which kind of document is put in so that's why we have these already pretty configured in the database but we also give we have some certain questions is that with that related to the to the document that is uploaded and if you look at the answers for these documents you realize that these are not just based on the document that is uploaded but rather on the on the east article late off his documentary processed so it gives you an answer that is satisfactory to the user but also has a certain kind of history that's good so that you get a more comprehensive answer rather than just what is written in the document and then you also have the functionality of use of questions that in the user can post any questions related to these and documents or refuse in general and then they'll be answered by them in addition to all of this we also have of eight for the user to configure certain elements so elements are nothing but the fees at least on the left so it use it can basically create click on argument and then create an element there and they can customize it to their need so if instead of keep it you just wanted effective dates you could essentially create a an element and give it a certain key of things to identify effectively so give given the right wording and then it it will be so given that i prompt and it will be able to fix the effect of dates for you so it is pretty customizable as aspect the users need so i and then there's one more tool that we have it's if it essentially works on, Start: 9:19, End: 11:46
Speaker 1: a similar principle but it's, Start: 11:47, End: 11:49
Speaker 0: more to do with document hide at the end so this this is another use case and this one is more to do with multiple documents within a contract and so i can show you the high active so if you look at this so you realize that these are there's a base agreement and we have certain amendments with this agreement then you have the so w so it this particularly is cases for a contract that have multiple documents and i sort of use and different amendments to to to be processed and the reserve for this is also based on going through all of the documents and then show casing what is the latest one so if you look at the example of let's say agreement effective date what happens is so ten times that effective date is mentioned in the let's say expired it expired in mentioned something in the base base agreement and then when an amendment is added to the base agreement and the experience is updated or the contract is extended so the door is intelligent enough to realize that teams and then showcase it under the history top so you can see that the initial date was the second from the base agreement then we have the last sign date from the amendment to base agreement the next week to end and set up the three so we also keep a truck of the history so this is more useful that and you have multiple documents within a contract and then you need to look at it and then an iraqi convey so this this tool this particular tool is specifically for that okay so, Start: 11:49, End: 13:29
Speaker 1: if you have multiple sort of identities to the base document and then you are looking for a what picture you don't want to look at document, Start: 13:29, End: 13:38
Speaker 0: yes and then this and this also we have certain key value parents can any extractions but we also have compliances so if you look at this so this has been trained on the language of the document and what it does is is good so it goes to the document based on what it has learned in the past it can give you comprehensive answer whether this particular document needs to create that i've been requires on our age it is the there are certain cases that it is in conclusive there are cases that it is partially matching and there are certain cases where it does not much at so it does highlight those kind of things and and let's use a known at that invite category this falling and then we have, Start: 13:39, End: 14:24
Speaker 1: easy these are pretty defined be complained with, Start: 14:25, End: 14:29
Speaker 0: it and, Start: 14:30, End: 14:30
Speaker 1: the agreement is complaining with each one of them whether these are included or not it is trying to extract it strength to, Start: 14:30, End: 14:39
Speaker 0: yes see, Start: 14:40, End: 14:40
Speaker 1: give the complaint status particularly, Start: 14:41, End: 14:42
Speaker 0: yes absolutely and then we have a protection which is basically, Start: 14:44, End: 14:50
Speaker 1: what these rules on my knowledge what is this notice dictionarily stationary this is particular to it was better for the oil td, Start: 14:51, End: 15:00
Speaker 0: who manage our contract and everything so these are very specific to the ideas case but we can also obviously have a different kind of frameworks that we define and the but it it will require a set of training process that will it and that it does go to and we were using discovery for it discovery and all it's today and that that's the underlying intelligence that that is there so these are and these these are to be very even find it very specific to the illegal contracts okay, Start: 15:01, End: 15:36
Speaker 1: basically for document is to be validated against the set of lose, Start: 15:37, End: 15:42
Speaker 0: yes, Start: 15:42, End: 15:42
Speaker 1: that can be defined with that it should comply with what it would be six seven, Start: 15:44, End: 15:49
Speaker 0: things certainly certainly it would decline up training process but yeah that that can certainly be done and it can be any room it can be as simple as we that this document is is containing the credit wordings or that it matches a certain idea what what with the rules that you can certainly configure it and train it on based on that given enough document yes, Start: 15:49, End: 16:13
Speaker 1: okay, Start: 16:16, End: 16:17
Speaker 0: okay, Start: 16:17, End: 16:17
Speaker 1: so the claims to interrupt is to compare to document which are forwarded to begin with which a similarly format even though that which is being the first one that you were showing we do that shared was something that was prepared for the csteem for risk manager so that i feel yeah this one only i think it's a more eleven off this one waiting for my speed it was expecting the concepts also and against each concept we could fill that which concept we want to eighty five and then it will show that what are the matching is it matching not matching confidence level thanks similar, Start: 16:17, End: 16:59
Speaker 0: that area, Start: 17:00, End: 17:01
Speaker 1: right and then go compare and then we can record the risk manager can record their feedback also that this is to be rectified or anything it can yes not you can do so you can, Start: 17:02, End: 17:14
Speaker 0: basically care and then give whatever feedback you have and then the record and in our system so then you export, Start: 17:15, End: 17:22
Speaker 1: how can this be sort of if somebody has to respond to this or things like that, Start: 17:23, End: 17:27
Speaker 0: so, Start: 17:29, End: 17:29
Speaker 1: currently the only, Start: 17:29, End: 17:30
Speaker 0: log this and then then we then we need to an export you'll be able to see it in the excel fine that is entered, Start: 17:31, End: 17:36
Speaker 1: yeah that was, Start: 17:37, End: 17:38
Speaker 0: yeah so if you're looking the excellent able to see all of this information but, Start: 17:39, End: 17:44
Speaker 1: yeah we can certainly add, Start: 17:45, End: 17:46
Speaker 0: kind of a comp communication channel between two two parties and you can you can see on all the comments that other and then even apply to it done that's okay, Start: 17:47, End: 17:56
Speaker 1: we meet in the will it sell, Start: 17:57, End: 17:59
Speaker 0: and into, Start: 18:00, End: 18:00
Speaker 1: rather than as a export and the, Start: 18:02, End: 18:03
Speaker 0: right trade, Start: 18:06, End: 18:06
Speaker 1: so actually what he did was the v, Start: 18:07, End: 18:09
Speaker 0: actually suggested that to the client of me and he a rather than exporting it into an excellent doing it outside of the why don't you i don't really do it for you inside the dull itself but they were adamant at having an excel to work with and they said they were more comfortable, Start: 18:09, End: 18:25
Speaker 1: isn't no so i think there are certain, Start: 18:28, End: 18:30
Speaker 0: talks going on it is not yet like but i think god would be able to give you more information on that but i think they were developed off going on finding finalizing certain things and then then they plan to go like so i think it's going to take a bit of time, Start: 18:30, End: 18:47
Speaker 1: okay, Start: 18:48, End: 18:48
Speaker 0: yeah, Start: 18:49, End: 18:49
Speaker 1: okay and i think those sections that you would have think of, Start: 18:51, End: 18:54
Speaker 0: these at the bottom i think these might might have been the one so don't identify what what could get, Start: 18:55, End: 19:05
Speaker 1: at the rent time they are, Start: 19:09, End: 19:10
Speaker 0: yes, Start: 19:12, End: 19:12
Speaker 1: right it's the section, Start: 19:13, End: 19:15
Speaker 0: of these these are not precondited not so, Start: 19:16, End: 19:18
Speaker 1: that this is what this is the miss the fuzz amended creator of these section of it and information date, Start: 19:19, End: 19:27
Speaker 0: can connect and if you, Start: 19:27, End: 19:29
Speaker 1: select a connection you'll only see, Start: 19:29, End: 19:31
Speaker 0: matches or defenses of that textion so you can see that it went from one to five and then you can only show you the ones that are and that are inside that particular belong to that particular section, Start: 19:31, End: 19:43
Speaker 1: okay, Start: 19:45, End: 19:46
Speaker 0: yeah and i think i did i go with the feedback part also you can basically i've been ready to saw that service, Start: 19:47, End: 19:58
Speaker 1: okay i think is that almost there's the same thing that that one that was in there the movie that was without think something this is sort of i think market yes, Start: 20:00, End: 20:09
Speaker 0: that would have been another project i think that might have been this one, Start: 20:09, End: 20:13
Speaker 1: sensitive, Start: 20:14, End: 20:14
Speaker 0: yeah thank this, Start: 20:15, End: 20:18
Speaker 1: this was one, Start: 20:19, End: 20:19
Speaker 0: so we have my complete documents a few documentaries when is b away and then someone so yeah, Start: 20:21, End: 20:29
Speaker 1: so this is the technologies of concern for this it's you said either blues what it's completely ninety this this one is, Start: 20:30, End: 20:37
Speaker 0: intimidated, Start: 20:37, End: 20:38
Speaker 1: okay completely please, Start: 20:38, End: 20:40
Speaker 0: have, Start: 20:40, End: 20:41
Speaker 1: cloud in what you said groma for victory number two, Start: 20:41, End: 20:48
Speaker 0: yes for this one we are using them at the model, Start: 20:49, End: 20:51
Speaker 1: but i think, Start: 20:52, End: 20:53
Speaker 0: this is also, Start: 20:53, End: 20:54
Speaker 1: not not why what cynics is it not why i watch an extent directly using, Start: 20:55, End: 20:59
Speaker 0: yes, Start: 21:00, End: 21:00
Speaker 1: but i, Start: 21:02, End: 21:02
Speaker 0: it it can us easily be done through the what's an example is it it's just a certain set of appear that you need to confidence i think it shouldn't be a problem we have done it for the other two weeks we have done it through what's next so we know certainly have experience of doing that on on a similar tool but i think this particular one is is running on honor that is deployed in ipan until gp plus, Start: 21:03, End: 21:29
Speaker 1: okay, Start: 21:31, End: 21:32
Speaker 0: okay, Start: 21:35, End: 21:35
Speaker 1: can they put any more any further questions again i can stop the recording date yeah i don't have any further questions here, Start: 21:36, End: 21:42
Speaker 0: stop sharing the boy, Start: 21:43, End: 21:44
